Feature: Collecting data on implants used
  As a user
  I should be able to add data on implant usage

  Scenario: Adding data on implants used in a surgery
    Given I am on the data entry page
    # Then I should see the name of the hospital
    # And I should see the name of the city
    # And I should see the form for entering the data
    # And I should see the button to move onto the next page
