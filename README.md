This project aims to build a web application that will aid ortho surgeons to update
data on implants used in joint replacment surgeries. This is done in several
countries through a registry. However, in many other countries such a registry is
missing. And the ones that exist are closed and the data from them is not readily
available for public consumption. The goal of this project is to also involve
patients actively in the data submission process, especially related to outcome
studies. The project **does not** intend to replace a well functioning registry.
